Pig Latin

Overview:

Do you get tired of those users who enter a room and chatter
on endlessly . . . not really saying anything, and not spending
any tokens either.  They treat that 1 lone token they've been
saving like a sacred family heirloom.  I know I do.  And I think
I know a few broadcasters who do as well . . .

This bot aims to nudge them towards either tipping more or rambling
less.  After a preset number of messages without a tip (default = 5)
all the chatty users' messages gets converted to pig latin ;-) If
the user continues to babble on in pig latin, he gets muted after a
preset number of messages (default = 10).  That's TOTAL messages
without a tip (i.e. with the default values, a user would get 5 regular
messages, 5 converted to pig latin, and then be muted on message #11).

Every time a user tries to chat while either on the pig or mute list,
he's reminded he can get off the list by tipping.  And to be fair,
if he DOES buy his way off the list(s), his limits will go up -- the
default increase is 2, but the broadcaster can set this higher (or even
0 if she doesn't want the limits increasing).
